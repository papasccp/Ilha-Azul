#What is Manézinho?

The nickname "manézinho", used to identify residents and descendants of Portuguese, 
especially from the Azores region, who settled in Florianópolis (Santa Catarina), originates from the nickname "Mané",
a diminutive of the name Manuel, very common in Portuguese culture. This tradition
was consolidated with the migration of Portuguese to the island, who became known as "manézinhos".

We adopted the nickname manezinho to name our filter, since it was previously developed for the city of Florianópolis, 
so this would be our way of showing affection for our city.
