# what is our Goals?
Firstly, our main propose was create a filter that has the ability to filter water and make it suitable for human consumption, without using electrical resources or using already treated water.
With that in mind, we could began to develop an affordable filter, cheaper than many others on the market, without the need for energy or running water, which would make life easier for people in riverside communities in Florian√≥polis, who use various resources to collect water and not all of them are the most suitable.
