# Ilha-Azul
Our social project consists of demonstrating where water, after possible filtration through a filter (Manézinho), can become drinkable according to WHO and ANVISA standards, providing access to drinking water in regions of Florianópolis, with the main objective of informing where MANÉZINHO can be implemented.
